            <h2>About Divide TTRPG</h2>
            <p>
              Divide TTRPG is an upcoming table top role-playing game that
              started as a humble passion project. Our journey began in 2015,
              with a group of middle school friends dreaming about creating a
              universe of their own. Drawing inspiration from an eclectic mix of
              sources – from Star Wars, Dark Souls, World of Warcraft, Skyrim,
              and Lord of the Rings, to the classic Dungeons and Dragons – we
              laid the foundation for Divide.
            </p>

            <p>
              What started as notes and sketches in a spiral notebook soon grew
              beyond our wildest dreams. As more friends joined our games and
              provided their valuable feedback, the game evolved, matured, and
              expanded. Today, Divide boasts over 500 pages of rules, lore, and
              features, with more exciting additions on the horizon.
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe that our strength lies in our roots. Our love for
              fantasy and gaming, our respect for the sources of our
              inspiration, and most importantly, the community that has grown
              with us – these are the ingredients that make Divide special. We
              hope you'll join us in this epic adventure.

            <h2>About The Character Sheet</h2>
            <img
              src="Resources/CharSheetFull.png"
              alt="Divide
        Map"
              class="map-image"
            />
            <p>
              The Character Sheet for Divide began as a simple sketch. This
              sketch laid the foundation for another sketch that then got
              scanned and printed. This was just the start though, slowly as the
              sheet became more refined, and the rules of the game developed,
              the character sheet gained a character of it's own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the first digital rendition of the character sheet was
              created, more and more revisions to it were made. As rules
              changed, the sheet changed with them. Just as much as the game
              itself has evolved, so has the character sheet. Now the sheet
              stands as an important piece of the game's history and a core item
              within it's functionality.
